          <h1>About</h1>
          <p class="my-4">Verity-Belle comes from the market town of Cowbridge in South Wales. She trained at The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, graduating with 1st Class Honours on the BMus programme and later, MMus Music Performance, with Distinction, in 2021.<br>
            As a Soprano, Verityʼs performance highlights include performing alongside the Welsh National Opera Chorus in Heggieʼs ‘Dead Man Walkingʼ, Janáčekʼs ‘The Diary of One Who Disappearedʼ with Nicky Spence and Simon Lepper and at The BBC Proms seasons with BBC National Chorus of Wales. She also regularly performs as a soloist alongside Choral Societies and Male Voice Choirs across the UK.<br>
            Verity has also worked alongside the BBC and Welsh National Opera, devising and recording Outreach projects and performances for the British Arts Council, Oasis Cardiff and UK- American Conferences.<br>
            She also leads weekly group singing lessons across South Wales at Stagecoach Bridgend, Cowbridge and Cardiff, teaching students from the age of 4-18. Working as the Vocal Coach for Stagecoach Performance and Show Troupes, Verity’s brilliant students regularly perform of West End Theatre Stages and Events. She loves the challenge of inspiring young people through music and they definitely keep her on her toes!<br>
            Verity’s passion for collaborative music making, leading and working with others is so evident in the work that she loves to do, as a Music Leader at The Forget Me Not Chorus.
            As a Music Leader, Verity is so lucky to have shared music journeys and joy with FMNC Choristers each week, since 2020. She currently leads a number of sessions in care homes and hospitals, as well as leading FMNC Newport on Wednesday afternoons.<br>
            Verity believes that there is truly, no better feeling than connecting with another soul through music; whether vocally, physically or through that deeper human connection. Every session is unique and wonderful in it’s own special way and she feels so lucky to call it her job!</p>
